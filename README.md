# 13F-Data-Analysis-Project

## Introduction: 
 
Hi there! I'm Joy Zhang, and I'm truly passionate about leveraging data to drive smart, impactful decisions.

The project leverages 13F filings to analyze the investment strategies of institutional fund managers in three sectors: stocks, cryptocurrency, and cannabis. It aims to identify the top three asset managers, compare their investment approaches, and determine if any funds are concurrently investing in both cryptocurrency and cannabis.

## Data:

The majority of the data for the project comes from the SEC's website at https://www.sec.gov/dera/data/form-13f. Additional data was supplemented from historical stock information available on Yahoo Finance for specific asset managers, including State Street (STT) and BlackRock (BLK), accessible at https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/STT/history/ and https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BLK/history/ respectively.
